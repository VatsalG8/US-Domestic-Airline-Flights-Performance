# US-Domestic-Airline-Flights-Performance
#This is a dashboard project, giving us insights on two things i.e., Yearly Airline Performance Report and Yearly Airline Delay Report between the year 2005 and 2020.

In Yearly Airline Performance Report, A TREE map was used to see the flight count by airline to destination state, A PIE chart was used to know the percent of flights by    reporting airline in that particular year, A CHOROPLETH map was used to see the number of flights from the origin state and a bar plot and line plot was used to see the monthly flight cancellation and average monthly flight time respectively.

In Yearly Airline Delay Report, line plots were used to better understand the ‘Average carrier delay time (minutes)’, ‘Average weather delay time (minutes)’, ‘Average NAS delay time (minutes)’,’ Average security delay time (minutes)’ and ‘Average late aircraft delay time (minutes)’.
